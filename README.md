# BotKit
BotKit is a Cocoa Touch static library for use in iOS projects. It includes a number of helpful classes and categories that are useful during the development of an iOS application.

## Installation

The fastest way to get started with BotKit in your project is by using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org). 

### Add BotKit to your Podfile

	pod 'BotKit', '~> 0.1'
	
### Install the dependencies

	$ pod install
	
### Import BotKit wherever it is needed

If this is your first Cocoapod, be sure to open the Xcode workspace instead of the project file when building your project.

	$ open App.xcworkspace
	
Import `BotKit.h` to get started.

	#import <BotKit/BotKit.h>
